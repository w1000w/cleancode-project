## Setup

Install dependencies from both backend and frontend separately running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Create an .env in both the root of backend and frontend folders with the following content (you can use whatever portnumber you see fit):

```
PORT=3000
```

Run the following command from separate terminals in both the frontend and the backend:

```
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to operate the app from the frontend using the address given to you by Vite.
